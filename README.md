NOTE: Uses Google's Text To Speech API.

What does this do.

This does NOT use exactly the same settings that Coffee Stain Studios use.
BUT will produce a voice that is close enough.

2. Follow steps 1 to 4F
3. Put JSON file you downloaded in AUTH folder

4. Enter Text to generate an MP3 for.
5. Click Generate
6. Save the file.
